# advertising-exclusion-lists
Advertising exclusion lists based on domains. Excluding fake news, sensationalism and party-affiliated propaganda.

The aim of the list is to help with easier blocking of displaying ads websites that promote harmful content. Given the wide-ranging content areas, the criteria can be somewhat subjective. Obviously you can add or omit from the list on your own. New domain suggestions welcome.
